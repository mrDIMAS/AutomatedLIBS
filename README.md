# AutomatedLIBS

This is my optical spectra analysis program I wrote for masters degree in ITMO University (Saint-Petersburg, Russia).

It can control Avantes spectrometers, identify spectra lines, calculate plasma temperature, calculate relative integral relations and many other things.

Here some papers related to the software.
